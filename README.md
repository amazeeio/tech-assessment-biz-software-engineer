# Full-Stack Assessment Task

## Objective
Create a simple full-stack web application to manage a collection of books. The backend should be built using NestJS and expose a GraphQL API for basic CRUD operations. The frontend should be built using NextJS and React.

## Backend Requirements
1. **NestJS**: Use NestJS to create your backend service.
2. **GraphQL**: Implement a GraphQL API with the following capabilities:
    - Query to fetch a list of books with their details (title, author).
    - Mutations to add and delete a book.
3. **Database**: Use an in-memory database or a simple array to store the data.
4. **Planning**: Before coding, jot down a brief plan outlining your approach. Include this in your README.

## Frontend Requirements
1. **NextJS and React**: Create a simple frontend to interact with your GraphQL API.
2. **List of Books**: Display a list of books with their details (title, author).
3. **CRUD Operations**: Implement UI elements to add and delete a book.

## GitHub Requirements
1. **Repository**: Create a GitHub repository for this project.
2. **Commits**: Make regular commits to show the progression of your work.

## Documentation
1. **Planning**: Include your initial plan as part of your submission.
2. **Code Comments**: Add inline comments for complex or non-intuitive parts of your code.
3. **README**: Include a README file detailing how to set up and run your project.

## Testing
1. **Unit Tests**: Write at least one unit test for your backend logic.

## Bonus Points
1. **E2E Tests**: Write end-to-end tests using either Cypress or Playwright.
2. **Attention to UI**: Show attention to detail in the UI, such as responsive design or smooth animations.

## Evaluation Criteria

1. **Functionality**: Does the application perform the required CRUD operations?
2. **Code Quality**: Is the code modular, readable, and adheres to best practices?
3. **GraphQL Implementation**: Is the GraphQL API well-designed?
4. **Frontend**: Does the frontend provide display the info? Is the code well-organized? Does the UI function?
5. **Git/GitHub**: Do the commits make sense? Is the repository well-organized? Can we follow along with the progress?
6. **Planning**: Was the plan well thought out? Can others follow the plan and understand the steps?
7. **Documentation**: Is the code well-documented, both inline and in the README?
8. **Testing**: Is the unit test well-written and does it cover an essential part of the application?
